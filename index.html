      Thanks to everyone for being a part of Paradise Lost.
      We've had some ups as well as downs, but we managed to form a fantastic community in a very short amount of time.
      I'm still <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/belak51">around on Steam</a> if you want to connect for whatever reason, even if it's only to rant. Just shoot me a message to let me know who you are.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finally, an extra round of thanks to The Lonely Tentacle and
Rumple-Nose Dimple who helped form and run Paradise Lost as well as all
our other admins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep on gaming and be good to each other.
